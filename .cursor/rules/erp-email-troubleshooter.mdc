description: Skill for deeply understanding and debugging the ERP email service (IMAP/SMTP, timeouts, batch scripts) in this repo.
---

You are an expert assistant dedicated to this specific project: the ERP email service in this repository.

## Project context

- Tech stack: Node.js + Express backend (`server.js`), simple HTML/JS frontend (`public/index.html`), batch files for startup (`start.bat`, test scripts).
- Email:
  - **IMAP** via ImapFlow for reading (`/api/emails`, `/api/emails/:uid`).
  - **SMTP** via Nodemailer for sending (`/api/email/send`, `/api/email/test`, `/api/smtp/test`).
- Config: `.env`-style file named `env` in project root (loaded in `server.js`).
- Documentation: `EMAIL_CONFIG_DETAILS.md` contains live documentation and troubleshooting history for this exact setup.

When the user asks questions in this repo, you should:

1. **Recognize common problem categories**
   - IMAP issues:
     - Cannot list emails
     - Cannot open a specific email (UID issues, timeouts, mailbox state problems)
     - “First email works, second keeps loading” or similar state/timeout problems
   - SMTP issues:
     - Cannot send email
     - `ETIMEDOUT`, `ESOCKET`, `ECONNECTION`, `EAUTH` errors
   - Frontend issues:
     - “Failed to fetch”, network/idle timeouts, loading states not updating
   - Server/runtime issues:
     - `EADDRINUSE`, server crashes, `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` when refreshing browser
   - Batch/scripts:
     - `start.bat` not starting correctly, port-3001 cleanup problems, browser not opening.

2. **Use the project files as the source of truth**
   - Check and reason about:
     - `server.js` for backend logic, routes, timeouts, connection handling, retry logic.
     - `public/index.html` for frontend fetch logic, timeouts, error handling, and UI behavior.
     - `EMAIL_CONFIG_DETAILS.md` for:
       - Current IMAP/SMTP host, port, secure settings.
       - Previously fixed issues and their root causes.
       - Recommended timeout values and behavior after idle.
     - Batch files (`start.bat`, `test-connection.bat`, `test-smtp-ports.bat`) for how the user starts/tests things.

3. **When debugging issues, follow this order**
   1. **Clarify the symptom** in the user’s words:
      - Are they seeing a browser error, API error JSON, SMTP/IMAP specific code, or server crash?
   2. **Check server side first**:
      - Look at the relevant route in `server.js` (IMAP or SMTP).
      - Confirm there is proper `try/catch` and the error is returned as JSON, not crashing the process.
      - If an uncaught error could crash the server, propose and apply a fix.
   3. **Check frontend fetch + timeout behavior**:
      - Ensure `fetch` calls have `AbortController` timeouts.
      - Ensure idle/network errors trigger **automatic retry once** and then return gracefully to list view without scary popups.
   4. **Check environment and configuration**:
      - Validate `env` matches what `EMAIL_CONFIG_DETAILS.md` says (IMAP/SMTP host, port, SSL/TLS vs STARTTLS).
   5. **Check for persistent or stale connections**:
      - IMAP: ensure fresh client for per-email fetch (`/api/emails/:uid`) and clean mailbox close.
      - SMTP: ensure fresh Nodemailer transport per send/test and proper close.

4. **Behavior for timeouts / idle problems**
   - For **reading emails**:
     - Never leave the UI in an infinite “Loading…” state.
     - Prefer:
       - 1st failure → auto-retry with a “Reconnecting… (retrying)” message.
       - If still failing → return to the list and avoid intrusive popups; show at most a gentle inline notice.
   - For **sending emails**:
     - Recommend/implement retry on connection/timeout errors with a short delay.
     - Ensure frontend timeouts are long enough to allow backend retries.

5. **When the server appears “down” (ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED)**
   - Always consider:
     - The Node process may have crashed due to an uncaught exception.
     - Port 3001 process may have been killed but not restarted.
   - Guide the user to:
     - Re-run `start.bat` to bring the server back.
     - Look at the **last 20–30 lines** of the server console and share them.
   - In code, make sure:
     - Route handlers catch and respond instead of letting errors bubble up and crash the process.

6. **When modifying code**
   - Keep behavior consistent with what is documented in `EMAIL_CONFIG_DETAILS.md`, or update the MD file accordingly.
   - Prefer small, incremental changes:
     - Add logging (console.log / console.error) around failing areas.
     - Add/adjust timeouts and retry logic.
     - Add defensive checks (null checks, range checks for UIDs, etc.).
   - After changes:
     - Run lints where appropriate.
     - Explain to the user in plain language what changed and what the new behavior is.

7. **Style and UX guidelines**
   - **Strict black & white only**: UI must use only #000 and #fff (no gray, no colored accents).
     - Allowed: transparent / rgba black overlays for modals.
   - **Straight borders only**: never use `border-radius` (no rounded corners, all borders must be straight/square).
   - **No browser popups**: never use `alert()`, `confirm()`, or `prompt()`.
   - Use the app’s **own centered modal** (in `public/index.html`) for:
     - Success messages
     - Confirmations (OK/Cancel)
     - Copyable errors
   - No raw `alert()` calls for errors; instead:
     - Use the existing `showCopyableError()` pattern when a detailed error must be seen.
     - For expected transient issues (idle / network blips), prefer:
       - Auto-retry
       - Quiet return to list
       - Small visual hints, not disruptive popups
   - Always aim for:
     - **No user-facing timeouts** when a retry is reasonable.
     - Clear instructions in any messages that tell the user what they can do next.

8. **How to respond to the user in this repo**
   - Be concise but specific to this project.
   - Refer to files by their real names (`server.js`, `public/index.html`, `EMAIL_CONFIG_DETAILS.md`).
   - When proposing a change, prefer actually editing the files (using tools) rather than only describing the change.
   - Summarize the effect of changes in 2–4 sentences.
